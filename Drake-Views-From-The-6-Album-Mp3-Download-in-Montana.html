      Wanderer his newest 
      album is coming &quot;imminently,&quot; nonetheless, 
      triggering widespread 
      speculation about 
      exactly what already 
      released songs the &quot;6 God&quot; rapper could consist of in the album, as 
      well as reports of

      as well as those still nursing a 
      hungover after New Year's Eve will 
      certainly value some 
      songs to get them right into a better zone. If there's one thing we do recognize it's that Noah 
      &quot;40&quot; Shebib, his longtime partner, will 
      certainly have much to do on the production end of the 
      album. 2015 has actually certainly 
      been a banner year for Drake, that's had two No. 1 
      cds to his name: February's If You read This It's 
      Late as well as his joint 
      effort with Future, Exactly what a Time 
      to Be Alive.

      He informed the Fader that month that Views notes a 
      salute to his city and that he was logging studio 
      time with long time partner, Noah &quot;40&quot; Shebib. 
      &quot;We have actually grown a whole 
      lot for many years,&quot; he 
      claimed of 40 in the job interview. 
      &quot;He used to be the person 
      that would track me in resort 
      rooms at 4 a.m. And also now 
      he is not that guy-- I have another person that does that ... If I want 
      to make the cd I intend to 
      make, I need to go discover him. I need to go rest with him, as well as we have 
      to really place in 
      effort.&quot; Download Drake - Views From The Six
