      It's been more than two years 
      because Drake 
      released an official studio 
      cd, and fans have 
      actually been itching to hear exactly what 
      tracks may be included in the 
      rap artist's most recent job, 
      Views From the 6. The Canadian rapper informed 
      Rolling Stone his latest 
      cd is coming &quot;imminently,&quot; nonetheless, 
      causing rampant 
      speculation concerning 
      what already 
      announceded songs the &quot;6 God&quot; rap 
      artist may consist of in the cd, in addition to reports of 
      cooperations and 
      possible track names on Drake's 
      4th workshop cd Drake Views From The 6 Album Download.

      Drake has 2015 and the year 
      hasn't already even involve 
      an official close. To continue his 
      reign right into the new year, the 
      Toronto rap artist could be 
      helping you kickstart your 2016 with his 
      very anticipated cd, 
      Views From the 6. January is the intended arrival 
      and also those still nursing a 
      hungover after New Year's Eve will 
      certainly value some 
      tunes to get them right into a better zone. If there's one thing we do understand it's that Noah 
      &quot;40&quot; Shebib, his longtime partner, will 
      certainly have much to do on the production end of the 
      cd. 2015 has absolutely 
      been a banner year for Drake, who's had 2 No. 1 
      albums to his name: February's If You're Reading This It's 
      Late as well as his joint 
      effort with Future, Exactly what a Time 
      to Be Active.

      He informed the Fader that month that Views notes a 
      salute to his city and that he was logging studio 
      time with longtime partner, Noah &quot;40&quot; Shebib. 
      &quot;We've grown a great deal over the years,&quot; he 
      said of 40 in the interview. 
      &quot;He made use of to be the man 
      that would track me in hotel 
      spaces at 4 a.m. As well as now 
      he is not that person-- I have another guy that does that ... If I intend to make the cd I want to 
      make, I have to go find him. I need to go rest with him, and also we have 
      to actually put in 
      initiative.&quot; Download Drake - Views From The Six

      Drake committed to Views From the 6 world-building 
      beforehand, throughout 
      a number of channels. 
      His perpetually upcoming 4th 
      studio album has come to be more of a continuous point of view than a potential project, 
      increasing into brand 
      publicity for the OVO 
      manager's alternating Toronto in 
      its extensive life-span.
