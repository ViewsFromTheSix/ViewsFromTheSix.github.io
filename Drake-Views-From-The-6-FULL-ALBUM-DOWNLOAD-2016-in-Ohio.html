      Rolling Stone his latest 
      cd is coming &quot;imminently,&quot; nonetheless, 
      causing widespread 
      conjecture about 
      what already 
      released songs the &quot;6 God&quot; rapper could consist of in the album, in addition to rumors of

      hungover after New Year's Eve will 
      undoubtedly appreciate some 
      songs to get them right into a much 
      better zone. If there's something we do know it's that Noah 
      &quot;40&quot; Shebib, his longtime partner, will have much to do on the manufacturing end of the 
      cd. 2015 has certainly 
      been a banner year for Drake, who's had two No. 1 
      cds to his name: February's If You're Reading This It's 
      Far too late and also his collaboration with Future, Exactly what a Time 
      to Be To life.

      He informed the Fader that month that Views notes a 
      salute to his city and that he was logging studio 
      time with long time collaborator, Noah &quot;40&quot; Shebib. 
      &quot;We have actually expanded a lot for many years,&quot; he 
      claimed of 40 in the job interview. 
      &quot;He used to be the person 
      that would track me in hotel 
      rooms at 4 a.m. As well as now 
      he is not that person-- I have one more man that does that ... If I wish to make the album I intend to 
      make, I have to go find him. I have to 
      go sit with him, and we have 
      to actually place in 
      effort.&quot; Download Drake - Views From The 6

      at an early stage, across 
      numerous systems. 
      His perpetually honest fourth 
      workshop cd has actually come to be even more of an ongoing perspective than a 
      prospective task, 
      expanding into brand 
      brainwashing for the OVO 
      employer's alternating Toronto in 
      its prolonged lifespan.
