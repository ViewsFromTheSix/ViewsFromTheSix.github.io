      actually been itching to hear just what 
      tunes might be included in the 
      rapper's most recent task, 
      Views From the 6. The Canadian rapper informed 
      Rolling Stone his most recent 
      cd is coming &quot;imminently,&quot; however, 
      triggering rampant 
      conjecture regarding 
      just what already 
      launched songs the &quot;6 God&quot; rap 
      artist could include in the cd, along with reports of 
      partnerships and 
      prospective track names on Drake's

      Drake owns 2015 and also the year 
      hasn't even come to 
      a main close. To proceed his 
      supremacy right into the brand-new year, the 
      Toronto rap artist can be 
      assisting you start your 2016 with his 
      extremely expected cd, 
      Views From the 6. January is the designated arrival 
      and those still taking care of a 
      hungover after New Year's Eve will 
      definitely appreciate some 
      songs to get them right into a much 
      better zone. If there's one thing we do understand it's that Noah 
      &quot;40&quot; Shebib, his longtime partner, will have much to do on the production end of the 
      cd. 2015 has actually definitely 
      been a banner year for Drake, who's had 2 No. 1 
      albums to his name: February's If You're Reading This It's 
      Far too late as well as his collaboration with Future, What a Time 
      to Be Active.

      He told the Fader that month that Views marks a 
      salute to his city and that he was logging studio 
      time with longtime partner, Noah &quot;40&quot; Shebib. 
      &quot;We have actually grown a lot throughout the years,&quot; he 
      claimed of 40 in the meeting. 
      &quot;He made use of to be the guy 
      that would track me in resort 
      spaces at 4 a.m. And also currently 
      he is not that person-- I have another person that does that ... If I want 
      to make the cd I wish to 
      make, I have to go locate him. I have to 
      go rest with him, and also we need to actually place in 
      initiative.&quot; Download Drake - Views From The 6

      Drake devoted to Views From the 6 world-building 
      beforehand, throughout 
      a number of channels. 
      His constantly honest fourth 
      studio album has ended up 
      being more of an ongoing point of view than a potential project, 
      expanding into brand 
      publicity for the OVO 
      manager's alternative Toronto in 
      its prolonged life-span.
