      hasn't even pertain to 
      an official close. To proceed his 
      regime right into the brand-new year, the

      assisting you kickstart your 2016 with his 
      highly anticipated album, 
      Views From the 6. January is the intended arrival 
      and those still nursing a 
      hungover after New Year's Eve will 
      undoubtedly appreciate some 
      songs to get them into a far better area. If there's one thing we do know it's that Noah 
      &quot;40&quot; Shebib, his long time collaborator, will have much to do on the production end of the 
      cd. 2015 has certainly 
      been a banner year for Drake, that's had two No. 1 
      cds to his name: February's If You're Reading This It's 
      Too Late and also his joint 
      effort with Future, Exactly what a Time 
      to Be Active.

      He informed the Fader that month that Views marks a 
      salute to his city which he was logging studio 
      time with longtime collaborator, Noah &quot;40&quot; Shebib. 
      &quot;We have actually expanded a great deal for many years,&quot; he 
      said of 40 in the meeting. 
      &quot;He used to be the guy 
      that would certainly track me in resort 
      areas at 4 a.m. And also currently 
      he is not that person-- I have another person that does that ... If I wish to make the album I intend to 
      make, I need to go find him. I need to go sit with him, as well as we have 
      to actually place in 
      effort.&quot; Download Drake - Views From The 6
