      very prepared for album, 
      Views From the 6. January is the desired arrival 
      as well as those still nursing a 
      hungover after New Year's Eve will 
      certainly value some 
      songs to obtain them into a much 
      better zone. If there's something we do understand it's that Noah 
      &quot;40&quot; Shebib, his long time partner, will 
      certainly have much to do on the production end of the 
      album. 2015 has absolutely 
      been a banner year for Drake, that's had two No. 1 
      cds to his name: February's If You're Reading This It's 
      Late as well as his collaboration with Future, Just what a Time 
      to Be Alive.

      He told the Fader that month that Views marks a 
      salute to his city which he was logging workshop 
      time with long time collaborator, Noah &quot;40&quot; Shebib. 
      &quot;We have actually expanded a lot over the years,&quot; he 
      claimed of 40 in the meeting. 
      &quot;He used to be the individual 
      that would track me in hotel 
      areas at 4 a.m. And also now 
      he is not that individual-- I have another man that does that ... If I want 
      to make the cd I wish to 
      make, I need to go locate him. I need to go rest with him, and we need to actually put in 
      initiative.&quot; Download Drake - Views From The 6
