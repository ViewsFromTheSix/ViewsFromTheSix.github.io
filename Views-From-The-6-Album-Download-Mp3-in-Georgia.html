      Views From the Six. The Canadian rapper informed 
      Rolling Stone his newest 
      cd is coming &quot;imminently,&quot; however, 
      causing rampant 
      conjecture about 
      just what already 
      announceded singles the &quot;6 God&quot; rapper could consist of in the album, in addition to reports of 
      partnerships as well as

      songs to get them right into a better area. If there's one point we do know it's that Noah 
      &quot;40&quot; Shebib, his longtime collaborator, will have much to do on the production end of the 
      cd. 2015 has absolutely 
      been a banner year for Drake, that's had two No. 1

      He told the Fader that month that Views notes a 
      salute to his city and that he was logging workshop 
      time with long time partner, Noah &quot;40&quot; Shebib. 
      &quot;We have actually grown a great deal over the years,&quot; he 
      claimed of 40 in the meeting. 
      &quot;He utilized to be the man 
      that would track me in resort 
      rooms at 4 a.m. And now 
      he is not that person-- I have another person that does that ... If I intend to make the cd I wish to 
      make, I need to go locate him. I have to 
      go sit with him, and we need to really place in 
      initiative.&quot; Download Drake - Views From The 6
